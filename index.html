                    <h3>Emisat: Innovative NOx Emission Reporting</h3>

                    <p>
                        Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from
                        the European Union is set to impact nearly 50,000
                        companies across the EU, mandating comprehensive
                        disclosure of environmental, social, and governance
                        (ESG) impacts. This new standard requires reporting on
                        how activities affect climate, human rights, and
                        pollution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At Emisat, we focus on providing cheap, fast, and
                        scalable NOx emission reporting for specific
                        locations. Our innovative approach adresses the issue of
                        costly on-site measurements and imprecise satellite
                        data, offering a solution that's both accurate and
                        accessible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through Emisat's services, companies can transition from
                        reactive to proactive environmental management, ensuring
                        compliance with CSRD and contributing to a cleaner, more
                        sustainable future.

                    <p>
                        Emisat harnesses the power of EU space technologies and
                        geospatial data by using Sentinel-5P NRTI NO2 and Global
                        Forecast System wind data. We combine these datasets
                        using state-of-the-art physical modeling approaches
                        based on scientifical research. We provide
                        high-resolution NOx emission estimates with improved
                        spatial granularity compared to current methods. We
                        leverage the solution proposed by Beirle, S., Borger,
                        C., et al. (2019). ‚ÄúPinpointing nitrogen oxide emissions
                        from space.‚Äù.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our innovative use of satellite measurements and wind
                        data allows us to pinpoint specific emission sources
                        like power plants, rather than just measuring raw NO2
                        levels. We also propose to track impact of this
                        pollution on nearby communities.

                    <h3>Appendix: physical modelling</h3>

                    <p>
                        Our model combines knowledge from top-down emission maps
                        with wind fields from ECMWF, to average horizontal
                        fluxes of NO2 which preserve strong gradients at point
                        sources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The NOx flux is given by: F = L*V*w
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Where L is NOx divided by NO2, V corresponds to NO2
                        tropospheric column and w corresponds to wind fields
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The divergence of the flux yields to emissions (E) and
                        sinks (S), from continuity equation at steady state: D =
                        E - S
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can describe the sinks by a 1st order time constant:
                        S = L*V/œÑ, where œÑ is the time constant for the
                        degradation of NOx gas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Emissions are calculated as follows: E = D + S =
                        ‚àá(L*V*w) + L*V/œÑ
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As divergence is a linear operator, the mean emission is
                        determined by the temporal mean sinks and the divergence
                        of the temporal mean flux.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to the divergence method and by applying a peak
                        fitting algorithm , we can provide a clear localisation
                        of point sources (e.g., power plants, cement plants)
                        with an accuracy below 2km.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Emissions uncertainty due to V, L and œÑ uncertainties in
                        optimal conditions is 42% (detection limit: 0.03 kg/s),
                        while it can go up to 65% in case of lower sensitivity
                        and sample sizes (detection limit: 0.11
                        kg/s). Measurements with cloud data fraction above 30%
                        were skipped.
