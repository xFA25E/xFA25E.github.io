we could add some links to the left footer and I could also make another page with project description (like in taikai)

I could also add a quote from ABB

and i was thinking on how to separate things more between "the problem" and "the solution":

    The Problem: Raw Emission Data

Initial satellite data shows NOx emissions, but it's affected by wind and other factors, making accurate measurement difficult.
Power Plant Location
Satellite view of the analyzed Polish power plant.

Raw NOx Emissions
Uncorrected emission data, showing the influence of wind on NOx dispersion.

    The Solution: EmiSat Model Results

Our model corrects for wind influence and other factors, providing accurate emission data.

Corrected Emissions Map
NOx emissions after applying our model, correcting for atmospheric disturbances.
Emissions Dashboard
Interactive dashboard providing detailed insights into emission patterns and trends.
Yearly emission and compliance

---done

remove the permitted level per day and exceedance for the table, now with the
regulation we are more in a yearly approach

maybe mention the name of the power plant and that its coal, the biggest thermal
plant Elektrownia Bełchatów, is the largest thermal power station in Europe and
one of the world’s largest coal-fired power plants.

2019 Beirle et al. study mention the name of the article "Pinpointing nitrogen
oxide emissions from space"
